Problem Statement
Task 1: Use the video links given below to build the 64 bit operating system. You can use the first video as learning example.

Task 2: You need to print SEECS or NUST (logo or text) using the characters (alphabetic, *, and / etc on the screen as shown in the image attached) instead of OK text as shown in the video. You also need to make a respository on github and upload all your code in the repo there along with the screenshot for the output on the main repo page (using readme.md file).

Task 3: Use hugo static site generator (https://gohugo.io/) to build a sample website where you will explain the working and development details of the OS using text and figures along with your profile/CV. you can use any template (https://themes.gohugo.io/) to get you started and finally host the website on github pages using your name like imranabeel.github.io.

Output: you will only share the website link and return the assignment.
